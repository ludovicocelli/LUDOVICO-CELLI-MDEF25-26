That\u2019s why I prototyped Backsense and Necksafe, two objects that are meant to increase the security at night, specially for women that may unfortunately face dangerous situation at night. 01/BACKSENSE Backsense is a hair clip that with embedded technology components is able to detect presence within a range of 10-15 meters. By being placed on the back of the head, the object function as an eye on the back: in case the infrared rays detect human presence within the said range, the object will vibrate, alerting the user, who can check his surroundings to swee if a danger is coming or not. A gps is also embedded inside the clip, allowing a third person to know the location of the user in case of danger, as well as an emergency button in order to alert a police station. 02/NECKSAFE Necksafe is a necklace that increases safety at night, being equipped with many functions. The gps combined with a camera get activated by entering in emergency mode and another button activates the pepper spray function to neutralize the aggressor. Day 02/ \u201cTo become something else\u201d To become a medium for pollinators In deciding my prosthesis following the statement \u201cto become something else\u201d, I asked myself how we as human species can collaborate to live in symbiosis with other species, trying to achieve a perfect balance where we give to other species just as much as we take from them. I immediately thought about the pollinators, their crucial importance for our ecosystem and the fact that they\u2019re being endangered by the humans\u2019 activities. Thus I decided to design a head prothesis that would be able to host pollinators\u2019 favourite plants like lavander, rosemary, calendula and so on. By wearing this prosthesis, humans themselves would be a space for pollinators to thrive, gently serving them as much as they serve us. Day 03/ \u201cHow do I want to be perceived?\u201d To only reveal what I want, to not be perceived, to be fully perceived Being perceived by the others is an experience that we all go through, but how does that makes us feel? Depending on certain factors, being observed generate in us feelings that might change completely from a situation to another. From a space to another one, from the presence of certain persons to others, from a mood to a different one, the way I want to be perceived varies a lot. That\u2019s what I wanted to communicate while performing during the 45 minutes I\u2019ve acted as somebody being followed by an unknown investigator from my class; I decided to use three different objects to represent my ideas, one every 15 minutes. To only reveal what I want At first I created a partial shield that was covering my face with a net: there are times where I want to show only the parts of me that I feel like allowing the others to see and nothing more, I\u2019m the one who decides what they can see and what they can\u2019t, I have control over my image and how this can be perceived, I select the parts of myself, aesthetic or internal, that people can experience. To not be perceived There are times where showing myself just doesn\u2019t feel right, and in a the world of today it\u2019s hard to take a position, stand for yourself and decide that you\u2019re not gonna share your image, being it digital or physical. But firmly denying the share of ourselves is as hard as it is important for our wellbeing, being able to hide and decide to not show any part of us is part of taking care of ourselves. To be fully perceived Finally, to act the last chapter of my performance, I took a metal made object and use it to reflect the sun on my face, to fully let the others see me. Those are the times I fully wanna be perceived, where I allow myself to be seen in all my details, in all my shades, in my vulnerability and in my strength. That\u2019s when I embrace being part of a bigger ensamble and allow myself to transparently share my image.
