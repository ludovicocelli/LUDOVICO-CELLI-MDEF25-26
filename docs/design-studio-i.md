# Design Studio I

In Design Studio I we're starting to get a hands on experience with the tools that can help us tackling the big challanges that design can solve.

#1 EMBODIED CRITICISM / Act 01: position yourself


In the first act of the embodied critism journey, we're asked to choose a topic that is really relevant for us and analyze it using the auto ethnographic method, doing a 1st person perspective research that can be expanded towards the others to create something meaningful.
