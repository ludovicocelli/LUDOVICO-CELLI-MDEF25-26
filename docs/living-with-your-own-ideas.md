# **Living with your own ideas**

**Day 01/ "To become the best version of myself"**

*To become the best version of myself is to help the others*



I approached the question "what is it to be the best version of myself?" trying to think differently, and I came to the reflection that to be the best version of myself is to help the others out. That's why I prototyped Backsense and Necksafe, two objects that are meant to increase the security at night, specially for women that may unfortunately face dangerous situation at night.













**01/BACKSENSE**


Backsense is a hair clip that with embedded technology components is able to detect presence within a range of 10-15 meters. By being placed on the back of the head, the object function as an eye on the back: in case the infrared rays detect human presence within the said range, the object will vibrate, alerting the user, who can check his surroundings to swee if a danger is coming or not. A gps is also embedded inside the clip, allowing a third person to know the location of the user in case of danger, as well as an emergency button in order to alert a police station.

**02/NECKSAFE**


Necksafe is a necklace that increases safety at night, being equipped with many functions. The gps combined with a camera get activated by entering in emergency mode and another button activates the pepper spray function to neutralize the aggressor.
