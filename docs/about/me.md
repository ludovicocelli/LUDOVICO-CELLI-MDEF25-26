Holding a bachelor in Industrial design at Politecnico di Milano and a master in Integrated Product Design at Politecnico di Milano, I have quite a technical approach when designing; I am now enrolled in the Master in Design for Emerging Futures at IAAC, Instituto de Arquitectura Avanzada de Catalu√±a, where I'm exploring more unconventional and radical ways to develop solution to the problems that needs to be faced in the close and further future. I deeply think that design must serve as a tool to solve concrete issues and tackle the big challanges that will determine the fate of the humankind. I'm passionate about social design, sustainable solution, waste reuse and music and everything that revolves around it.
